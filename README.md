# LZW Compression Algorithm

The Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm. It is an adaptive compression algorithm that does not assume prior knowledge of the input data distribution.. It is simple to implement and has the potential for very high throughput in hardware implementations.
